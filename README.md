# GUI-Calendar
A GUI representation of a calendar built using swing

Used the Model, View, Controller Pattern to build it. 

The Model was the calendar and the events stored in a TreeMap. 
The View was the month view and the day view. 
The Controllers were the previous and next buttons as well as each day which was clickable.
